## CS 255 - 8-2 Journal: Portfolio Submission

**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**
DriverPass was looking to outsource the building and implementation of a new application that allowed customers to manage their reservations while employees could administer on their end. The system was supposed to manage, organize, and provide authorized access to customer information, DMV test results and scheduling, their LMS for customers to take online classes, and an interface for both customer and employee to create, modify, and cancel reservation for classroom and in-person driving lessons.

**What did you do particularly well?**
I believe that I did best when it came to planning for all possible user experiences in order to optimize the project. I repeatedly simulated going through the system as the customer in order to identify potential bugs, loopholes, and erroneous logic. Planning for all potential output scenarios was something I worked towards.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
I would like to develop the part of the system that gets into permissions and authentication for the different security clearance levels of the DriverPass employees. The interview transcript included a part about how certain people would need unrestricted access while others should only be able to work on the tasks specific to their job role. I would include a highly detailed breakdown of each employee, if provided, as well as their effective permissions for accessing the system.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
After creating an initial, basic diagram of the system, I tried to experience it from the perspective of the end user. While doing so, I made notes of things that were missing and should be included, problems I encountered, or parts of the experience that took too much time or were too complicated to work through. The whole point of the project is to create a new interface for the customer, therefore their experience and opinion is most important since they are the source of revenue.

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**
I always try to take a two-sided approach to developing any software code. I begin by building code and logic up from nothing as a developer would do to gradually meet the requirements of the project. At points throughout the process, I take the opposite perspective of the end user (customer, administrator, etc.) and try to identify breakpoints and flaws within the logic in an effort to correct them. In the future I would use unit testing, integration testing, and even write some Junit code in order to make my testing approach as effective as possible. I would also always work to make the code as modular as possible so that any errors could be more easily identified.

## CS 230 Operating Platforms Reflection

**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**
The Gaming Room hosts a web browser based app, which they would like to expand to be available to mobile users including Android OS, Windows Mobile OS, iOS, et al. They require a seemless transition from UI/UX between their existing web based platform and the newly developed mobile ones so that the end user's experience is consistent among devices running on different OSs. They required a template to address security, memory/storage management, database implementation and administration, and hybrid cloud implementation.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**
The most useful experience in designing the template was in comparing the pros and cons of coding the app for the different OS platforms. It helped to higlight the strengths of each particular brand. Security standards, programming language, and mobile app store compliance were well developed recommendations in the document.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**
It was particularly helpful to go through all aspects of the I/O process required for each individual OS. The parts of coding for successful communication between all hardware devices served as a base from which to expand upon software requirements, and ultimately UI/UX requirements. While the target OS determined the specific language needed, the general logic was the same across all different implementations.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
I would like to revise the specifics on security. Finding the perfect balance between implementing adequate security protocols to protect user data and activity while maintaining a fluid and user-friendly, intuitive experience is key. I would also like to implement more of the code and algorithms I used on different IDEs to ultimately finish creating the actual app.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
I believe that it was essential to conduct some role play in my head prior to working on the project. Starting as the client, or game host, I listed the requirements throghout the experience of administering the game successfully. After, I repeated the process as the end user, and then began to bridge the different requirements among common ground. This provided the foundation from which to write successful implementation recommendations.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**
As a data analyst, a fundamental approach I take to solve any problem or complete any project is to cite a successful example to use as a paradigm. Next, generalize the specifics and minutia within the code so that the logic and framework is applicable to programs outside of what it was created for. Finally, replace the generalized pieces of code to fit your plan and achieve your goal.
