For this project, we were given the code for an agent to navigate a cyber maze and we have to enhance that process through code. Computer scienctists optimize everything that is electric and they are needed because they fix and optimize the things that we need and don't even know it. It is important to abide to the ethical tenents of honoring privacy, don't monetize off of destructive programs, and don't plagarize code.

## CS 305 - Portfolio Submission - Software Security

“Artemis Financial desires to modernize its operations and, as a crucial part of the success of its custom software, they want to implement and apply the most current and effective software security. Artemis Financial has a RESTful web application programming interface (API) and is seeking…expertise in taking steps to protect the organization from external threats.”

Artemis is looking for a development team that will review their systems in order to identify any and all potential security flaws. They prioritize the safety and privacy of their consumers; therefore they are outsourcing experts in vulnerability assessment so that they may fix any problems within their IT infrastructure.

Their vulnerabilities were pretty straightforward, and the Maven dependency test was crucial in identifying potential flaws. After eliminating false positives, the check provided a blueprint of what to seek and fix within Artemis’ current code. Coding securely is essential to the success of any business because you are always dealing with a client, and their safety and privacy are paramount to any business model. Security makes people feel safe, especially in the age of frequent digital hacking. People gravitate toward a company with a history of successfully fending off cyber criminals.

Working through the initial vulnerability assessment was a very systematic and logical experience. By using the VAPFD as a guide throughout the process, it was easy to detect potential flaws within the code and the system itself. The layout itself is very self-explanatory. After identifying threats, it was fascinating to investigate their causes to determine the different layers of security involved with safeguarding a system. By re-running software after dependency checks and alterations, it was possible to view whether the application was fixed or not. This was a great tool in alerting me to return to problematic code that negatively affected the program. Also, re-running the dependency check after the fixes were applied was a great starting point to determine if I needed to return to the code or leave it working as is. for future employers, I would demonstrate my work by showing them the Module 6 assignment.

## CS 255 - 8-2 Journal: Portfolio Submission

**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**
DriverPass was looking to outsource the building and implementation of a new application that allowed customers to manage their reservations while employees could administer on their end. The system was supposed to manage, organize, and provide authorized access to customer information, DMV test results and scheduling, their LMS for customers to take online classes, and an interface for both customer and employee to create, modify, and cancel reservation for classroom and in-person driving lessons.

**What did you do particularly well?**
I believe that I did best when it came to planning for all possible user experiences in order to optimize the project. I repeatedly simulated going through the system as the customer in order to identify potential bugs, loopholes, and erroneous logic. Planning for all potential output scenarios was something I worked towards.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
I would like to develop the part of the system that gets into permissions and authentication for the different security clearance levels of the DriverPass employees. The interview transcript included a part about how certain people would need unrestricted access while others should only be able to work on the tasks specific to their job role. I would include a highly detailed breakdown of each employee, if provided, as well as their effective permissions for accessing the system.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
After creating an initial, basic diagram of the system, I tried to experience it from the perspective of the end user. While doing so, I made notes of things that were missing and should be included, problems I encountered, or parts of the experience that took too much time or were too complicated to work through. The whole point of the project is to create a new interface for the customer, therefore their experience and opinion is most important since they are the source of revenue.

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**
I always try to take a two-sided approach to developing any software code. I begin by building code and logic up from nothing as a developer would do to gradually meet the requirements of the project. At points throughout the process, I take the opposite perspective of the end user (customer, administrator, etc.) and try to identify breakpoints and flaws within the logic in an effort to correct them. In the future I would use unit testing, integration testing, and even write some Junit code in order to make my testing approach as effective as possible. I would also always work to make the code as modular as possible so that any errors could be more easily identified.

## CS 230 Operating Platforms Reflection

**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**
The Gaming Room hosts a web browser based app, which they would like to expand to be available to mobile users including Android OS, Windows Mobile OS, iOS, et al. They require a seemless transition from UI/UX between their existing web based platform and the newly developed mobile ones so that the end user's experience is consistent among devices running on different OSs. They required a template to address security, memory/storage management, database implementation and administration, and hybrid cloud implementation.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**
The most useful experience in designing the template was in comparing the pros and cons of coding the app for the different OS platforms. It helped to higlight the strengths of each particular brand. Security standards, programming language, and mobile app store compliance were well developed recommendations in the document.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**
It was particularly helpful to go through all aspects of the I/O process required for each individual OS. The parts of coding for successful communication between all hardware devices served as a base from which to expand upon software requirements, and ultimately UI/UX requirements. While the target OS determined the specific language needed, the general logic was the same across all different implementations.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
I would like to revise the specifics on security. Finding the perfect balance between implementing adequate security protocols to protect user data and activity while maintaining a fluid and user-friendly, intuitive experience is key. I would also like to implement more of the code and algorithms I used on different IDEs to ultimately finish creating the actual app.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
I believe that it was essential to conduct some role play in my head prior to working on the project. Starting as the client, or game host, I listed the requirements throghout the experience of administering the game successfully. After, I repeated the process as the end user, and then began to bridge the different requirements among common ground. This provided the foundation from which to write successful implementation recommendations.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**
As a data analyst, a fundamental approach I take to solve any problem or complete any project is to cite a successful example to use as a paradigm. Next, generalize the specifics and minutia within the code so that the logic and framework is applicable to programs outside of what it was created for. Finally, replace the generalized pieces of code to fit your plan and achieve your goal.
