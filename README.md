## CS 230 Operating Platforms Reflection

**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**
The Gaming Room hosts a web browser based app, which they would like to expand to be available to mobile users including Android OS, Windows Mobile OS, iOS, et al. They require a seemless transition from UI/UX between their existing web based platform and the newly developed mobile ones so that the end user's experience is consistent among devices running on different OSs. They required a template to address security, memory/storage management, database implementation and administration, and hybrid cloud implementation.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**
The most useful experience in designing the template was in comparing the pros and cons of coding the app for the different OS platforms. It helped to higlight the strengths of each particular brand. Security standards, programming language, and mobile app store compliance were well developed recommendations in the document.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**
It was particularly helpful to go through all aspects of the I/O process required for each individual OS. The parts of coding for successful communication between all hardware devices served as a base from which to expand upon software requirements, and ultimately UI/UX requirements. While the target OS determined the specific language needed, the general logic was the same across all different implementations.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
I would like to revise the specifics on security. Finding the perfect balance between implementing adequate security protocols to protect user data and activity while maintaining a fluid and user-friendly, intuitive experience is key. I would also like to implement more of the code and algorithms I used on different IDEs to ultimately finish creating the actual app.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
I believe that it was essential to conduct some role play in my head prior to working on the project. Starting as the client, or game host, I listed the requirements throghout the experience of administering the game successfully. After, I repeated the process as the end user, and then began to bridge the different requirements among common ground. This provided the foundation from which to write successful implementation recommendations.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**
